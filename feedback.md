# Feedback

## Code Quality: Excelling
Code looks solid, sensible named variables, love all the comments and explanations on what the code does. 
* As your apps get bigger the more files you deal with. I would create a folder for your css files. When dealing with sass it makes a few; you don't lose points for this, but it could look neater. 

## Technical requirements: Excelling
So awesome you learned new tech for this! The important skill here is being able to pick something up and learning how to understand it. 

## Creativity and Interface: Performing
Your game is easy to use and look at.
* It would've been cool to see it be responsive for mobile
* the input box that takes the hidden word maybe make it disappear when the word is inputted? and maybe at a rest button for it to reset and make it come back? 
* I would play with some google fonts. Since you didnt go with the original stick figure, type treatment would be killer.  

## Presentation: Excelling
* Keep track of the errors you had on the way
* talk about features you made for it in your repo. 
* the more you talk about your app on your repo the better. 

## Additional Feedback
* I left some feedback on your js file. but most of it is here
* whenever you iterate through the length of something just make it a forEach method. 
* You're killin it dude!
